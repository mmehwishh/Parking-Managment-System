# Parking Management System (Assembly Language)

This is a simple Parking Management System developed in Assembly language(8086). It demonstrates basic system-level programming by handling user input and simulating real-world parking operations like entry, exit, and time tracking.

Features
- Add vehicle entry
- Manage vehicle exits
- Track parking time (or simulate duration)
- Display total vehicles and parking info
- Console-based interaction using keyboard input

 Technologies Used
- Assembly Language (x86 architecture)
- MASM (Microsoft Assembler)

 Concepts Demonstrated
- Low-level I/O handling
- Register and memory operations
- Conditional branching and loops
- User interaction through ASCII-based input

 How to Run
1. Open the `.ASM` file in  MASM.
2. Compile and link:
